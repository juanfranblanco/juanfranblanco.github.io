Also a Nokia 950 XL and the new USB hub, but lets start with a new laptop.

It seems that "the thinnest, most powerful PC ever created", configured as a proper workstation with 512 SSD, 16GB RAM, and 6th generation Intel processor will cost "only" 2,699 dollars. 

So, in the UK, with the excuses of taxes and conversion, that might be the same number but changing the currency ┬ú2,699.

Price aside, it might be a win-win-win situation, a light workstation that can turn into a tablet, with all the surface pro features.

Press release:

>Building on its track record of pioneering new categories, Microsoft is redefining the laptop with the new Surface Book ÔÇö a powerful, high-performance laptop with stunning craftsmanship and incredibly accurate and responsive pen and touch support. Ultrathin, Surface Book combines the impressive power of 6th Generation Intel┬« CoreÔäó i5 and CoreÔäó i7 processors with up to 12 hours of battery life4. The 13.5-inch optically bonded PixelSense Display delivers a high-contrast 267 dpi display with improved latency and parallax, making it not just beautiful to look at but natural and fluid to write on. The screen also detaches, so it can be used like a clipboard to sketch, take notes and benefit from Windows programs like Microsoft Edge. An optional discrete GPU allows Surface Book to harness the full power of hardware-accelerated graphics for seamless video editing, fast rendering or immersive gaming. Surface Book starts at $1,4995.
