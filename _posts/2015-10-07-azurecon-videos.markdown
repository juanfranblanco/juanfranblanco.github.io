Presented by: Martin Wahl</p>   <h4><a class="azurecon-video-link" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/videos/azurecon-2015-azure-iaas-proper-sizing-and-cost/">Azure IaaS: proper sizing and cost</a></h4> <p>Two of the most frequently asked questions about moving to Azure IaaS are ÔÇ£How do I size it?ÔÇØ and ÔÇ£What will it cost me?ÔÇØ These questions arenÔÇÖt easy to answer. Many tools will tell you how to move an on-premises computer to an Azure virtual machine assuming that what you have now is exactly what you need in Azure. In this session, youÔÇÖll learn that it is possible to accurately determine what size Azure virtual machines you need and how to calculate the most cost-effective way to move to Azure. YouÔÇÖre moving to better, faster hardware, so why would you need the exact same number of virtual machines with the exact same memory and CPUs? Servers can be consolidated and sized appropriately when the recommendations are based on analysis of the actual performance of the existing servers with a mind for consolidation using very precise calculations of the performance capabilities of the Azure environment. In addition to performance, you can accurately determine your best options based on costs for Azure in terms of storage, storage transactions, networking, and Microsoft SQL Server licensing. Would you be better off moving 5 on-premises servers on a standard A7 virtual machine or would 3 servers on a standard A5 and the other 2 on a basic A3 be more cost effective? This can be calculated.

Not only do they use several SaaS applications, but they would like to have single sign-on to the cloud and on-premises. This complex activity creates a blind spot in identity and security, opening up your network to malicious attackers. Today, more than 75% of security breaches stem from compromised user credentials. In this session, learn how Azure Active Directory and Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics help you to secure and manage user identity in your business, identify security breaches before they cause damage, and give your users a single identity for accessing all corporate resources. We will discuss the technologies used to discover Shadow IT, manage application access, and monitor suspicious activity through advanced security reporting, user behavioral analytics, auditing, and alerting.
